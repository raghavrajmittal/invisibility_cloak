# invisibility_cloak
One of the deathly hallows in our possession! Let's wear Harry's cloak of invisibility!

Simply run invisibility_webcam.py and your red blanket turns into a cloak of invisibility.

PS: Be sure to not be in the frame for the first 3 seconds (while it creates the background)!


## To do:
1. Try making a human disappear? Bounding box for any person, segmentation map
2. Make only myself disappear? Face detection + recognition
3. Make objects I'm holding not disappear (so object detection + map + restore pixels )
4. Easily be able to switch colors
5. Output video
